# stack operation (using c-programming SLL DLL).
The Stack Operation project demonstrates how to manage a stack data structure in C, utilizing both singly linked lists (SLL) and doubly linked lists (DLL). Users can perform essential stack operations and explore the differences between these two implementations.<br>

<br>**Features**<br>
**Push Operation**: Add an element to the top of the stack.<br>
**Pop Operation**: Remove the top element from the stack.<br>
**Display Operation**: View all elements in the stack from top to bottom.<br>
<br>**Project Files**<br>
**SLL Implementation**: Contains the source code for stack operations using a singly linked list.<br>
**DLL Implementation**: Contains the source code for stack operations using a doubly linked list.<br>
<br>**How It Works**<br>
**Push Operation**: Elements are added to the top of the stack, with pointers updated as needed in both SLL and DLL implementations.<br>
**Pop Operation**: The top element is removed from the stack, with pointers adjusted accordingly.<br>
**Display Operation**: All elements in the stack are displayed, starting from the top and moving to the bottom.<br>
